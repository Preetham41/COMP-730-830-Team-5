**COMP730 / COMP830 Final Project Proposal**

**Project Goal**

Build a bookstore application that connects to a database of available books. Our idea is inspired by the Online Book Store Project on kashipara.com. The link to the original project can be found here: [kashipara.com/project/java/1227/online-book-store-java-project](https://www.kashipara.com/project/java/1227/online-book-store-java-project).

**Features of the Application**

- Allow user to choose a book from a database of books.
- Allow user to choose the quantity of books they would like to buy.
- Allow user to choose whether they would like to pick up the book themselves or have it delivered to them.
- Provide weekly/monthly bestsellers as recommendations.
- Provide bookworm facts that refresh every time the user opens the application.

**Project Achievement Levels**

- 50%: Have working options for the user to modify for choice of book, quantity, payment, and pickup/delivery.
- 75%: Have a partially working database that updates book quantity.
- 100%: Have a working application that effectively connects to a database and allows the user to interact with it in the above ways.

**How To Access**
Class files are located in "/Bookstore/src/main".
